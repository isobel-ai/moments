# moments

> An audio-first worship platform that captures and preserves the full story of an encounter with God.

Moments is built around a single idea: **a Moment is the audio plus everything around it.** From quiet time and prayer to living rooms, conferences and spontaneous gatherings, moments records the sound and the context that makes it meaningful — the scripture that inspired it, the prayers prayed, the revelations received, and the highlights worth returning to.

## What is a Moment?

A **Moment** is the core object of the platform. It is the audio recording plus the story that surrounds it:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sound** | Recorded in the app or uploaded. Stored privately, streamed via signed URLs. |
| **Context** | Title, date, place, people, artwork and type. |
| **Scripture** | The verses that inspired or were referenced during the Moment. |
| **Prayers** | What was prayed during or because of the Moment. |
| **Revelations** | What was learned or understood. |
| **Highlights** | Meaningful timestamps with a short note. |

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (LTS)
- npm 10+ (or pnpm)
- Expo CLI (`npx expo`)
- A Supabase project (local or hosted)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the mobile app

```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

This starts the Expo dev server. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app, or press `a` / `i` to open the Android emulator / iOS simulator.

### Local Supabase

```bash
npm run supabase:start
npm run supabase:migrate
```

This starts the local Supabase stack and applies the migrations in `supabase/migrations/`.

### Environment variables

Copy the example env files and fill in your values:

```bash
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env
```

Never commit real secrets. See `.gitignore`.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev:mobile` | Start the Expo dev server |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check all packages |
| `npm run lint` | Lint all packages |
| `npm run supabase:start` | Start local Supabase |
| `npm run supabase:migrate` | Apply migrations |
| `npm run supabase:stop` | Stop local Supabase |
