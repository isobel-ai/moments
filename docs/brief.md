# Product Brief — moments

## Problem

Worship encounters are fleeting. The sound is often captured, but the story
around it — the scripture that inspired it, the prayers prayed, the revelation
received — is lost. People want to preserve the *whole* encounter, not just the
audio.

## Vision

Moments is an audio-first worship platform that captures and preserves the full
story of an encounter with God, from quiet time and prayer to living rooms,
conferences and spontaneous gatherings.

## The core object: a Moment

A **Moment** is the audio plus everything around it.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Sound** | Recorded in the app or uploaded. Stored privately, streamed via signed URLs. |
| **Context** | Title, date, place, people, artwork and type. |
| **Scripture** | The verses that inspired or were referenced during the Moment. |
| **Prayers** | What was prayed during or because of the Moment. |
| **Revelations** | What was learned or understood. |
| **Highlights** | Meaningful timestamps with a short note. |

## Personas

- **The quiet-time keeper** — records personal devotionals and wants to revisit
  the scripture and prayers that shaped them.
- **The worship leader** — captures spontaneous and conference moments and
  wants to share highlights and revelations with a team.
- **The family** — preserves living-room worship and the prayers prayed together.

## Principles

1. **Audio-first.** The sound is the heart of a Moment; everything else is
   context around it.
2. **Private by default.** Audio is never publicly downloadable. Users stream
   via signed URLs.
3. **Capture is effortless.** Recording and adding context should take seconds.
4. **Meaning over volume.** Highlights, revelations and scripture make a Moment
   worth returning to.
